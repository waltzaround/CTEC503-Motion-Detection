# CTEC503 Interactive Motion Detection

Project that reads webcam input by detecting color changes in pixels. Displays people in front of webcam as black and white rotating silhouettes if sufficient movement is detected, and plays music depending on intensity, and duration of movement. Project was developed with the Processing Framework. You should try dancing in front of it for a few minutes...
